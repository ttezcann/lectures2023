# Reading reflections

## Introduction

Students will submit a reading reflection <mark style="color:red;">(250 words or more)</mark> on an assigned reading before each lecture.

After completing the reading, students write brief responses (i.e., at least several sentences) to two questions. While the first question asks for the main points of the reading, the second question needs students to focus on a specific issue in the reading. Then, students formulate a question about the specific issue that they discussed in the second question. Students should make sure to provide enough justification/ground in Question 2 for their question to provoke some discussion.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Question 1:**</mark> What is the main point of this reading? What is the main idea that the reading points out? Your response is not a summary of the readings, but an analysis of it in a way that creates new meaning for you **(30 points)**.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Question 2:**</mark> What is the specific issue/topic you are most interested in presented in assigned reading for the lecture? Write a paragraph to teach this specific issue/topic to your peers and prepare to present it in class **(40 points)**.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Your Question:**</mark> The purpose of this section is to dive deeper into the specific topic or issue you discussed in Question 2, stimulating a rich discussion among your peers. Your question should be about the specific issue/topic you stated in “Question 2”, something you already know the answer to.&#x20;

Your question should be comprehensive, requiring multiple follow-up questions. While the primary inquiry should be explicit, it should be detailed and complex enough to open avenues for extensive discussion. Your question should spark some discussion and you will be able to lead that discussion (**30 points)**.

* **Complexity**: Instead of posing a single, broad question, present a primary question followed by 2-3 related follow-up questions. This layered approach will allow for more nuanced discussions.
* **Specificity**: Avoid vague or over-generalized questions. They should relate directly and specifically to the topic you presented in Question 2.
* **Depth**: Each question should invite in-depth analysis and reflection, rather than simple 'yes' or 'no' answers.
* **Open-endedness**: While you should already know the answers to your questions, they should be crafted in such a way that they encourage diverse viewpoints and interpretations.
* **NO policy-oriented questions:**  Policy-oriented questions, such as <mark style="color:red;">**“what can we (or society, governments, etc.) do to help,”**</mark> while significant in their own right, are not acceptable in this course as they often assume the existence of certain societal patterns without a prior rigorous understanding and analysis. We must first focus on acquiring an in-depth understanding of societal structures, interactions, and patterns to form well-informed inquiries before we delve into policy considerations or suggestions.

{% hint style="danger" %}
* Students should not provide direct quotes from the readings, but explain them in your own words **(Otherwise -10 per direct quote)**.
* Students should not mention the title of the reading **(Otherwise -10)**. For example, “The article of The Past, Present, and Future of Research in Distance Education: Results of a Content Analysis concentrates on….” Instead, type “the reading,” “the article,” etc.
* Students also need to put the word count (WC) at the end of the post: (WC: 262) **(Otherwise -5)**.
{% endhint %}

## Rubric for grading

Responses to questions clearly indicate careful reading and deep reflection.&#x20;

Your questions will be evaluated based on academic quality, sociological, methodological, and reading relevancy.&#x20;

Descriptive and policy-oriented questions like

* “What are the different sampling strategies? Describe and discuss”,&#x20;
* “What should society do to eliminate discrimination?”,&#x20;
* “How can we fix the labor market barriers”,&#x20;
* “What can we (or society, governments, etc.) do to help immigrants in terms of housing, educational opportunities, etc.”,&#x20;

Questions with answers that are already on the reading like

* "What are the two border control strategies?",
* "What are the different sampling methodologies?"

will result in <mark style="color:red;">zero points</mark>.

## Samples

### Sample 1

**Q1:** The main point of this chapter is to deepen your understanding of the basic logic of sociology as proposed by Marx, Weber, and others. Sociology allows us to identify and recognize the social forces underlying social phenomena through ethnographic and other studies. By reading this chapter, I could learn about many theorists who have made the foundation of sociology as a whole. In this article, sociological concepts can be used to read about gender inequality and social interrelationships in the aspect of women working for low wages as luxury hotel maids.

**Q2:** <mark style="background-color:orange;">(Cultural ideals and social contradiction)</mark> I was interested in the topic of cultural ideals and social contradictions, as advocated by Martineau. Because, although this was an issue she was championing in the 1800s, I thought it had some relevance to the world today. Martineau was a woman and a feminist sensitive to inequality, and she emphasized the fact that women were excluded from full democratic participation in society. She was also particularly critical of racial inequality in the United States, including the issue of slavery, and the contradiction between democratic ideals and the inequality of women. Today, slavery has been abolished and society has changed to one in which women can vote and participate in politics. However, racism and gender inequality still have not completely disappeared. The ideal of democratic equality has not been realized even now, more than 100 years after she advocated the contradiction between cultural ideals and social contradictions. It was very interesting to be able to empathize with a sociologist living in a past era about similar contradictions.

**YQ:** What are "ideals"? As described in Q2, Martineau refers to cultural "ideals". Marx refers to the "ideals" of equality, and Tocqueville makes a statement about the "ideals" of freedom. The content of "ideal" may differ from person to person, but what exactly are the "ideals" that they are aiming for?

### Sample 2

**Q1:** In this chapter, we delve into the topic of survey methods. When I first heard of the word survey methods, I just assumed it simply involved different ways of collecting data when conducting a social research project. But we are taught in this reading that survey methods are in fact the study of value deviations and the accuracy of survey production. We learn how to pay attention to the quality of a survey by examining its design, data collection process, analysis, etc. The ultimate goal of survey methods is to improve the quality of survey estimates, especially within cost restraints. Not only is it a science, but it is also a major part of commerce and government. I never really gave a second thought to how data was collected for such things as national health, drug use, or even about politics. I was aware of the census survey due to my knowledge of Chicano history, which not many people know but the term “Hispanic” was not a label Hispanic peoples took on by their own volition, rather it originates from the census.

**Q2:** <mark style="background-color:orange;">(Purpose of Surveys)</mark> The topic that really enveloped me was the brief overview on the purpose of surveys and its evolving history. Surveys were first conceived as a way of understanding social problems. Meanwhile market research analysts and journalists used surveys to keep their ear to the streets and know what their fellow man was feeling about such things as political leaders and what issues were important to them and why? This led to the creation of public opinion polling. Market research began to use survey samples that were collected from a wider pool, in order to gather information that was more valuable in commercial decisions. Both polling and market research eventually led to the use of mail and phone surveys. Their sampling pools were typically from available sources like telephone lists, registered voters, magazine subscriptions, etc. They collected data by asking a strict set of questions, they valued what people thought and felt.&#x20;

**YQ:** In light of the shifting social landscape and rapid technological advancements, it is evident that survey research methods have undergone significant transformations over the decades. Considering the present state of technological advancement and the scope of our current capabilities: How do you anticipate the future evolution of survey research or discern the ways in which it has already evolved within our society? In what ways have changing societal norms and values impacted the effectiveness and relevance of survey research?

### Sample 3

**Q1:** In the reading, we learned about deviance as a social relationship. Deviance in sociology refers to behavior that goes against social norms. Sociologists study deviance and culture to understand better how social norms and values are constructed and enforced and how they impact individuals and groups within society. Merton's strain theory explains that deviance stems from the strain individuals experience when they cannot achieve socially approved goals through legitimate means. This dissatisfaction can lead individuals to turn to deviant behavior to cope. Merton identified five possible modes of adaptation to this strain, including conformity, innovation, ritualism, retreatism, and rebellion.

**Q2:** <mark style="background-color:orange;">(Strain theory)</mark> Merton's strain theory explains that deviance arises when individuals feel frustrated and unable to achieve socially approved goals through legitimate means. Merton identified five modes of adaptation to this strain: conformity, innovation, ritualism, retreatism, and rebellion. Conformity involves accepting society's ideals and means, while innovation involves accepting the goals but rejecting the norms. Ritualism consists of rejecting the goals but accepting the standards, and retreatism involves refusing society's goals and means. Rebellion consists of dismissing society's goals and means and creating new ones. These modes provide insight into why individuals may engage in deviant behavior and how society can encourage or discourage it. This sociological lens allows us to critically analyze the multifaceted reasons behind deviance and devise proactive approaches to shape a more harmonious and functional society.

**YQ:** In what ways does Merton's strain theory provide insight into the intricate dynamics of race, class, and gender intersectionality when it comes to understanding and explaining deviance within society? How does this theoretical framework shed light on the unique experiences of individuals and communities who find themselves labeled as deviant due to the overlapping effects of these social factors? Additionally, what are the implications of Merton's theory for the social, psychological, and economic well-being of those who are marginalized and stigmatized by society as a result of their deviant categorization?

### Sample 4

**Q1:** This chapter contains Durkheim's interpretation of sociology and an explanation of the elements that make up society. I had thought that societies are always changing and difficult to distinguish, but I learned that sociologists distinguish between traditional and modern societies, which border on the economic, social, and technological changes that took place in the late 19th century. It also describes various aspects of the community that builds society, such as mechanical solidarity by occupation or faith, social density attached to physical density, or moral density. Furthermore, the chapter describes research using a wide range of sociological perspectives, such as taking up the issue of suicide as an anomaly that threatens social cohesion.

**Q2:** <mark style="background-color:orange;">(Social Morality)</mark> It was a very interesting part of the book because it described that for Durkheim, morality is the formal and informal social rules that govern the behavior of individuals in society. When I did observations in libraries, I wrote "customers in the store take it for granted that we are supposed to enter the store first and stand in line behind those who are waiting, but I felt that this was also an action in accordance with a social norm”. I felt that this was also an action in accordance with a social norm. I felt that, although we are unaware of it in our daily lives, we act in concert with others and are regulated by others.

**YQ:** Is the solidarity that derives from shared experiences, beliefs, and sentiments really harder to find in modern societies? Because I feel that modern society is superior to traditional societies in terms of social networking and systems that make it easier for individuals to express their feelings, empathize, and build solidarity.Within this chapter, it is stated that in contemporary urban societies, Durkheim posits that the collective conscience exerts a diminished force, displaying reduced breadth and influence over the individual. Why would Durkheim expressly state this?

### Sample 5

**Q1:** The focus of today's assigned reading is the basis of sociological theory and who/what has contributed to its foundation. Throughout reading this chapter, I learned of many different theorists who have contributed to the development of sociology as a whole. The author collected many different viewpoints of the evolution and development of sociology, such as Comte, Martineau, De Tocqueville, Rosseau, Locke, and many others. The main point I gathered from today's reading was about the foundation and evolution of sociology as what is known today; a studied, respectable science.&#x20;

**Q2:** <mark style="background-color:orange;">(Social contract)</mark> This theory, formed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, is based on the assumption that all people can come to a "common good", and be more dedicated to that then their own self-interests. The example given in the topic of his theory is the debate of abortion, and how Western countries have made this act legal, even though some in these areas disagree. The legality of this act has barriers to it though, boundaries of how long the pregnancy can be, circumstance, etc. This practice of legality with boundaries is an example of a middle ground, or the "common good" Rosseau is proposing. It is practically impossible to not have a community be divisive on any subject (even trivial debates, like ketchup versus mustard). Rather than finding something to please both sides, the consensus that has been drawn in the case of abortion is just enough to contain societal order, but does not necessarily satisfy either side of the debate. This topic of a "common good" is a very practiced ideology at its core, but to get rid of individualism and self-interest, as Rosseau proposes, sparks a great concern and interest to me.&#x20;

**YQ:** How does Rousseau conceptualize the notion of the "common good" as a unifying force capable of binding an entire society together? In what ways did Rousseau rationalize his emphasis on shared interests and collective goals, as opposed to individualistic pursuits? Can this ideology of a common good extend beyond the realm of politics and find relevance in other aspects of life? Are there any sociological implications of Rousseau's belief in a shared interest that can be explored?

### Sample 6

**Q1:** In the reading, it overviews the idea that ethnic diversity is accompanied by ethnic stratification leading to the idea that the majority of the white population is at the top of the hierarchy and minorities that come from less developed countries can be seen at the bottom. In the reading, it stated that there is a growing social census and that neighborhood deprivation may be an important factor above and beyond the parental social disadvantage. As they stay in these tight-knit communities they feel more comfortable as the majority of these people may experience similar events or experiences. Migrants are disadvantaged because the overall process is uncontrollable when it comes to roadblocks. Such roadblocks immigrants may encounter are social background, language fluency, social capital, prejudice, and discrimination. It was said that minorities are proven to have bigger continuation rates in their educational career, but minorities experience cumulative disadvantages and other barriers in the labor market.&#x20;

**Q2:** <mark style="background-color:orange;">(Discrimination and racism)</mark> Specifically, when exploring the experiences of immigrants seeking citizenship, the concept of institutional discrimination plays a crucial role in shaping their employment prospects. Additionally, students from immigrant backgrounds often encounter significant disparities in academic achievement, reflected in lower test scores throughout their school trajectories. Moreover, discrimination within the labor market serves as a compelling explanation for the persistent struggles faced by minority populations in securing employment opportunities. By examining these sociological dimensions, we can gain a deeper understanding of the multifaceted impact of discrimination and racism on immigrants' lives and societal inclusion.

**YQ:** In the context of sociological analysis, the literature suggests that teachers in Denmark tend to hold lower expectations for students with immigrant backgrounds compared to their peers. This raises an important question about the fairness of such differential expectations. Should teachers not treat all students equally by setting uniform expectations, even if it requires providing additional support to certain students? How do teachers' expectations influence the educational experiences and achievements of students with immigrant backgrounds? Are these lower expectations contributing to an achievement gap between students from different backgrounds?
