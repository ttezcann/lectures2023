## <mark style="color:orange;">The policies about reporting word counts</mark>

* In most of the assignments, you will be asked to provide a word count of your responses.&#x20;
  * If there's a single question, you will target the provided minimum word count.&#x20;
  * If there are multiple questions, I will provide the minimum word count with and without question prompts.&#x20;
    * Highlight your responses <mark style="color:red;">with the question prompts,</mark> and report the word count with question prompts.
    * When there are multiple questions for an essay, the stated minimum word count applies to the <mark style="color:red;">collective (combined) responses</mark>, not to each question
  * You can exceed the provided word counts.
* When there is a “WC” (Word count) section under the responses, provide the word count; otherwise, there will be a **-5% deduction**.&#x20;
* Reported word counts must be accurate. Incorrect counts result in a **-5% deduction**.
  * Discrepancies within ±2% of the actual count are considered negligible and will not be penalized.

## <mark style="color:orange;">General policies about writing</mark>

My primary focus is always on the quality of your critical thinking, the depth of your analysis, and the originality of your ideas as demonstrated in your writing.&#x20;

Your assignments require precise arguments, specific evidence, and concrete examples directly from our course materials and your sociological imagination.&#x20;

**Every single word** and **sentence should serve a function**. If removing certain words or sentences would not affect your arguments, then they should be removed.&#x20;

When you are writing, you bring your own experiences, your own voice, and your own unique way of connecting ideas.

The following will negatively affect your grade:

1. <mark style="color:red;">**Broad, general statements lacking specificity:**</mark> Vague claims, unsupported generalizations, or arguments that could apply to any context rather than the specific one presented in specific lectures.
2. <mark style="color:red;">**Overly formal and generic language:**</mark> Using sophisticated vocabulary and formal sentence structures, but often in a way that feels detached or lacks personal voice. I do not care about the grammar or word choice. I value your unique thinking over "perfect" academic prose. Assignments are training fields for improving writing skills. Writing improves thinking skills.&#x20;
3. <mark style="color:red;">**Lack of original interpretation:**</mark> Failing to generate novel insights or truly original arguments.
4. <mark style="color:red;">**Absent or weak authorial stance:**</mark> Responses that read like neutral encyclopedia entries, where the analytical position never becomes clear.
5. <mark style="color:red;">**Generic or cliched examples:**</mark> Using highly generalized or textbook-perfect examples that lack the specificity or personal touch that comes from genuine engagement with the material.
6. <mark style="color:red;">**Synthetic neutrality:**</mark> Providing a perfectly balanced, "encyclopedic" summary of a topic that lacks a distinct, personalized, or sociological stance. If the writing is too "safe" and non-committal, it fails the requirement for original interpretation.
7. <mark style="color:red;">**Predictable or template-based structure:**</mark> Prioritizing a rigid, repetitive, or formulaic organization (e.g., most sentences starting and ending with nearly identical structures) over the organic development of a unique personal voice.
