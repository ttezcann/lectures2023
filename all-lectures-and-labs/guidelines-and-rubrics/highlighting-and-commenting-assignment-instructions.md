# Highlighting and commenting assignment instructions

## <mark style="color:orange;">Synopsis</mark>

Students are encouraged to annotate the instructions following the guideline below before starting the assignment. Highlighting and commenting assignment instructions is optional.

{% hint style="info" %}
When someone else reads students' comments, they should be able to understand the overall purpose of the assignment and the detailed steps involved.

<mark style="color:red;">Outline what the assignment entails and what is expected of you</mark>.
{% endhint %}

The comments should be in the form of <mark style="color:red;">self-talk</mark> and/or <mark style="color:red;">to-do list</mark>. For example, "_I need to go to this website first, and learn such and such_" or "_This task requires a newspaper article. I may use the one I read this morning_."

**Based on the assignment, there are two approaches:**

1. **Beginning to end:**
   * Highlight and comment on the entire set of instructions first.
   * Once highlighting and commenting are completed, proceed with the assignment.
2. **Step-by-step:**
   * Highlight and comment on each specific task as you encounter it.
   * Complete the highlighted and commented task before moving to the next one. Continue this process until all tasks are completed.

All the instructions in an assignment are subject to this procedure.&#x20;

Do not highlight and comment on your own answers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Highlighting and commenting should be completed before starting the assignment. Any highlighting and commenting done after completing the sections of the assignment <mark style="color:red;">defeats the purpose</mark>.
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:orange;">**Instructions**</mark>

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Purpose:**</mark>&#x20;

Use highlighting and commenting to actively engage with and understand the assignment instructions. These tools help you focus on the most critical aspects, ensuring a clear grasp of the required tasks.

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Guidelines for Highlighting and Commenting**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:orange;">**Highlight Key Elements:**</mark> Focus on highlighting the most critical parts of the instructions. This includes main tasks, specific questions, and any particular requirements for the assignment.
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Complement with Notes:**</mark> Enhance your highlights with brief comments. These should explain why a section is highlighted or record additional thoughts. It's not necessary to comment on every highlight, but include a few insightful comments. This is a space to engage in self-dialogue, making these truly personal comments.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Review and Reflect:**</mark> After highlighting and commenting, take a moment to review what you have highlighted and commented. This is a good time to ask yourself if the highlighted and commented parts clearly <mark style="color:red;">outline what the assignment entails and what is expected of you</mark>.
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Avoid Over-Highlighting whole sections:**</mark> Do not highlight entire paragraphs or pages. The goal is to pinpoint the most important information, not to colorize large sections of text.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Focus on why you are doing this:**</mark> Highlighting and commenting are not just about marking or commenting text — it's about actively engaging with and understanding your assignment. Use it as a tool to enhance your focus and comprehension.
