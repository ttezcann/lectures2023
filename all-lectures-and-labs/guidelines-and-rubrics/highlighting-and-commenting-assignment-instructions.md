## <mark style="color:orange;">**Instructions**</mark>

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Purpose:**</mark>&#x20;

Use highlighting and commenting to actively engage with and understand the assignment instructions. These tools help you focus on the most critical aspects, ensuring a clear grasp of the required tasks.

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Guidelines for Highlighting and Commenting**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:orange;">**Highlight Key Elements:**</mark> Focus on highlighting the most critical parts of the instructions. This includes main tasks, specific questions, and any particular requirements or criteria for the assignment.
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Complement with Notes:**</mark> Enhance your highlights with brief notes or annotations. These should explain why a section is highlighted or record additional thoughts. It's not necessary to comment on every highlight, but include a few insightful comments. This is a space to engage in self-dialogue, making these truly personal comments.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Review and Reflect:**</mark> After highlighting and commenting, take a moment to review what you have highlighted and commented. This is a good time to ask yourself if the highlighted and commented parts clearly outline what the assignment entails and what is expected of you.
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Avoid Over-Highlighting:**</mark> Do not highlight entire paragraphs or pages. The goal is to pinpoint the most important information, not to colorize large sections of text. If you find yourself highlighting too much, take a step back and reassess what is truly essential, as this defeats the purpose.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Focus on why you are doing this:**</mark> Highlighting and commenting are not just about marking or commenting text — it's about actively engaging with and understanding your assignment. Use it as a tool to enhance your focus and comprehension.

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Rubric**</mark>

This task does not contribute directly to your grade, but failure to effectively highlight and comment as per these guidelines <mark style="color:red;">**may result in a loss of up to 10 points**</mark>. Although all assignments come with clear tasks and are objectively graded, this is the part that will be graded in a semi-subjective way.

The "highlighting and commenting" part of the assignments that appear to have been completed with minimal effort and superficially will lose up to 10 points. It is students' responsibility to demonstrate and convince the instructor that they have thoroughly read and understood the instructions. For instance, if there are explicit instructions to complete a particular section of the assignment and the submission does not comply, points will be deducted for failing to highlight and comment as required.
