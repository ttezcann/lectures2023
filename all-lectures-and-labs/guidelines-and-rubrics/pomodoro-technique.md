# Pomodoro technique

Pomodoro is a method of time management. A timer is used to break up work into intervals, generally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

The original technique has six steps:

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes)
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
5. If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
6. After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step
