## The goal

The goal of writing a final research paper is to&#x20;

* Confirm or reject your hypotheses, and answer your research question
* Explain in detail the theoretical and empirical grounds/justifications, and the methodological choices
* Discuss the results and conclude the paper (Discussion and Conclusion section)

{% hint style="info" %}
Writing is easier as you read
{% endhint %}

In this stage of your research, you finalize your research paper.

Everything you wrote for the draft research memo or other assignments can be used for your final paper.

The final research memo builds on the draft research memo (see the Qualitative DRAFT Research Memo Guideline and Rubric for details on which assignments are used to complete the draft research memo).

&#x20;There are three main tasks:

1. Improve the sections and subsections by citing minimum 12 peer-reviewed journal articles in APA format. You may want to use these citations to "Introduction",  "Theoretical structure and hypotheses", and "Discussion and Conclusion" sections/subsections.
   1. Use [\[Citation chaining procedure\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/citation-chaining-procedure)
   2. Use [\[ResearchRabbit: Literature discovery engine\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/researchrabbit-literature-discovery-engine)
   3. Use [\[Selective literature review\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/selective-literature-review)
   4. [\[How to determine peer-reviewed journal articles?\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/how-to-determine-peer-reviewed-journal-articles)
   5. [\[How to use zbib.org for citations?\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/how-to-use-zbib.org-for-citations)
2. Write the "Discussion and Conclusion" section
3. Write the "Abstract"&#x20;
   1. This should be the last section you will write

## 7. Sections

1. **Abstract:** The abstract summarizes the content of your paper. It should provide the reader with a quick overview of the entire study, with the following information: (1) Importance of the topic and/or reference to the current literature and/or identification of a knowledge gap, (2) Aim(s) of the current study, (3) Indication of the methods used, (4) Statement of the key finding(s), and (5) Implications of the findings and/or Value of the current study. The abstract should not contain any undefined abbreviations or unspecified references. Provide an abstract of 100 to 150 words. Abstract is the last section you will write, after completing the paper.
2.  **Introduction and background:** Clearly state the topic. What are you investigating? What is the significance of the topic? Why does it matter? Highlight the significance of the topic. Mention your research question here with its reasoning. Cite some of your sentences here. State your research question.\


    Indicate an issue, problem, or controversy in the field of study. Where does the field lack knowledge and how is your research filling that gap? Then, end this section by providing an overview of the structure of the paper:\


    _The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, it starts with X. Then, it presents an overview of the theoretical arguments and existing empirical research on X, Y, and Z… After describing the methods and sample, the study's findings are introduced. The final section summarizes and discusses the study's main contributions._
3. **Theoretical structure:** Review the literature and construct relevant associations to your own research topic. Do not summarize others’ works like A claimed this, B asserted that! Analytically use and interpret them as long as they benefit your own research. Define the key concepts (variables) here. For instance, if you are working on return migration, explain and cite what return migration is. Under section 3, you will provide a broader explanation of the literature. You will be more specific under the subsections 3.1., 3.2., and 3.3.

* **3.1. “The relationship between first independent variable and dependent variable” (You will name this subsection with your first focused code):** Review the specific relevant literature about the relationship between your first independent variable and dependent variable. Provide at least two citations. Explain what you expect to find and your reasoning. End this subsection with your first hypothesis.
* **3.2. “The relationship between second independent variable and dependent variable” (You will name this subsection with your second focused code):** Review the specific relevant literature about the relationship between your second independent variable and dependent variable. Provide at least two citations. Explain what you expect to find and your reasoning. End this subsection with your second hypothesis.
* **3.3. “The relationship between third independent variable and dependent variable” (You will name this subsection with your third focused code):** Review the specific relevant literature about the relationship between your third independent variable and dependent variable: This is your first third code. Provide at least two citations. Explain what you expect to find and your reasoning. End this subsection with your third hypothesis.

4.  **Methodology:** In the Methodology section, give an account of how you carried out your research. An experienced researcher should be able to repeat the research and reproduce the results based on this section.



    Your content analysis should include online newspaper articles, newspaper article comment sections, any social media platforms, YouTube comment sections, or blogs, etc. Explain from which media platform you got data. What are your data selection criteria? Describe all your methodological choices. Paste the links of the data at the end of this section (Newspaper article, Facebook group, Instagram posts, etc.)

    1. **Data sources links:** Paste the links of the data sources (Newspaper articles, Youtube videos, etc.)
5.  **Results:** The standard approach to this section of a research paper is to present and describe the results in a systematic and detailed way. You will highlight and comment on the themes that emerge from the analysis. More elaborate commentary on the results is restricted to the Discussion and Conclusion section.\


    Discuss your initial, axial, and focused codes here, and organize your results based on the focused codes. Remember not to include all your results. You should present and discuss only those findings that relate to your hypotheses and accordingly your research question. Do not just summarize your content; you should direct the reader to the component or components of it that are especially striking from the point of view of your research aim. Try to ask yourself what story you want the content to convey and try to relay that story to your readers. Provide some quotations from the content you used.
6.  **Discussion and conclusion:** In the Discussion and Conclusion section, you reflect on the implications of your results for the hypothesis that has driven your research. In other words, how do your results illuminate your hypotheses? The discussion will revolve around whether the hypotheses have been confirmed or not, and, if not, you might speculate about some possible reasons for and the implications of their refutation.\


    Suggest some ways in which your findings have implications for theories relating to your area of interest. It is valuable to propose areas of further research that are suggested by your findings.
7.  **Coding file:** Put the data coding file link here (My data).&#x20;

    File <mark style="color:red;">➜</mark> Share <mark style="color:red;">➜</mark> Share with others <mark style="color:red;">➜</mark>  Copy link. If I do not have access to this document, you will no credit.
8. **References (Bibliography):** Provide the end-text citations of 12 sources (ONLY peer-reviewed journal articles) that you already provided the in-text citations in APA style. Books, book chapters, or other sources, such as reports found on google or websites, are NOT acceptable.
9. &#x20;**Self-grade sheet**

## 8. Grading

As no two research papers are the same, grading will be a somewhat subjective business. The concepts, literature, and analysis you pursue will differ in many ways from research papers written by your peers. However, below I provide a list of things I expect to find in all research papers. These are the things on which I will assess the research papers and assign grades. The research paper is worth 100 points, and there are items below, which are worth different points each.&#x20;

I will rate your research papers from these items and the sum will represent your research paper grade. The grading of each item will be based on how clearly and completely you address each question posed.

Below I provide a list of things I expect to find in all research papers. These are the things on which I will assess the research papers and assign grades. The research paper is worth 100 points, and there are items below, which are worth 3 to 15 points each.&#x20;

I place no strict limits on the length of each section. Your goal is to specifically discuss and justify your research, which generally takes 2,500 words of text (12-point Times New Roman font with 1” margins, (single spaced typed), excluding bibliography references. If you do not meet the minimum word count (2,500 words), your grade will be adjusted proportionally.

## 10. Reminders

**Reminder 1:** Submissions without data analysis that is generated in "Coding your own data for draft research memo" will automatically receive zero.

**Reminder 2:** Do not use direct quotes from the peer-reviewed articles (-10 points for each):&#x20;

**Reminder 3:** When citing peer-reviewed articles, only provide the in-text citation within the text and the end-text citation under the references (bibliography), do not write the title of the article in the text.

Should be:&#x20;

“Szinovacz (1998) argued that grandparenthood has a multifaceted nature which lacks clear perceived and ascribed roles, and may embody different meanings, expectations and experiences in distinct cultural settings.”

“Family unity across generations is vital for family survival (Nesteruk and Marks, 2009).”

NOT acceptable (-10 points for each):&#x20;

* “In his work entitled ‘<mark style="color:red;">Research on grandparenting: needed refinements in concepts, theories, and methods’</mark> Szinovacz (1998) argued that grandparenthood has a multifaceted nature which lacks clear perceived and ascribed roles, and may embody different meanings, expectations and experiences in distinct cultural settings.
