# Letter of recommendation requests

You have emailed me requesting a letter of recommendation. I have sent you this link as I would be happy to serve as your recommender.

To accept a recommender role, I expect students to meet the following criteria (which you meet):

* Earned an A from my class(es)
* Maintained regular attendance
* Actively contributed to class discussions
* Demonstrated strong teamwork skills
* Did not request any special treatment in coursework
* Exhibited professionalism in our interactions

## Types of recommendations I provide:

1. ### Scholarship and graduate school applications (Confidential letters):
   1. You must "**waive your right to see the letter of recommendation"**. These letters are confidential exchanges between the recommender and the recipient institution. They are crafted with the understanding that the content remains private, allowing for a more candid assessment. When students retain access rights, it disrupts this understanding. If you are unfamiliar with this, a quick Google search about the norms of waiving rights surrounding recommendation letters will provide some insights.
2. ### Job applications
   1. For job applications, employers contact me directly via **phone** or **email** to ask their questions.
   2. I **do not** provide non-confidential recommendation letters (letters that students collect and submit themselves). This is not about secrecy but rather about maintaining the integrity of the recommendation. Without it, there's a perception that the recommender might not be as open or honest, which can unintentionally cast a shadow over the recommendation's credibility. Having been involved in hiring processes before, I can confirm that such letters are not read or taken into consideration.

## Timeline - How much time do I need?

* Minimum **21 days**.
* Since each application has different requirements, enter my contact information (located at the very bottom of this page) into the application system and send me your responses (as described in the next section) **at least 14 days before the deadline**.

## Next steps – What I need from you?

If the nature of this recommendation is confidential, email me (<mark style="color:blue;">ttezcan@csumb.edu</mark>) the following:

1. When is the letter due? If applying to multiple programs, provide the earliest deadline.
2. Describe any contributions, achievements, or skills you demonstrated in my class(es) that you’d like me to highlight.
3. Share your career aspirations and how this opportunity aligns with them.
4. If this a scholarship application, send me the scholarship ad (scholarship name, organization offering it, and specific criteria or qualities they are looking for).
5. If this a job application, send me the job ad (position name, organization, and specific criteria or qualities they are looking for).
