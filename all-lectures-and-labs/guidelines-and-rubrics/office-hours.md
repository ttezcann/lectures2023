You may email me if the regular office hours absolutely do not work for you, but you must include a wide range of availability for each day. For example: ‚ÄúI am available on Monday from xx:xx to xx:xx, xx:xx to xx:xx, xx:xx to xx:xx; on Tuesday from xx:xx to xx:xx, xx:xx to xx:xx, xx:xx to xx:xx; on Wednesday from xx:xx to xx:xx, xx:xx to xx:xx, xx:xx to xx:xx,‚Äù etc.&#x20;

Please note that I cannot guarantee a meeting will be scheduled. Do your best to attend during regular office hours.

Attending office hours is a great resource when you have questions. Please feel free to schedule a meeting with me. I hold these office hours for questions about class materials, your projects, your research, my research. Please note that **I do not do pre-grading, but I can answer specific questions about assignments**.

Attendance Policy of CSUMB states:

‚ÄúIt is not possible for the instructor to ‚Äòreplicate‚Äô the day's learning experiences. Therefore, while the instructor is available for general consultation regarding the class's scheduled activities and progress, it is important for students to avoid requesting special assistance of this type from the instructor.‚Äù

If you have questions about a missed lecture, **you need to watch the lecture video before the meeting.** This means I will not be able to address any questions that are already clarified in the video. Please note the timestamp of any part of the lecture video you have questions about. The meeting will begin with a discussion of the video. If you do not watch the lecture video beforehand, the meeting will be postponed.
