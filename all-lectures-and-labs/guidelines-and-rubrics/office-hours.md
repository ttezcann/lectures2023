Attending office hours is a great resource when you have questions. Please feel free to schedule a meeting with me. I hold these office hours for questions about class materials, your projects, your research, my research. Please note that **I do not do pre-grading, but I can answer specific questions about assignments**.

Attendance Policy of CSUMB states:

“It is not possible for the instructor to ‘replicate’ the day's learning experiences. Therefore, while the instructor is available for general consultation regarding the class's scheduled activities and progress, it is important for students to avoid requesting special assistance of this type from the instructor.”

If you have questions about a missed lecture, **you need to watch the lecture video before the meeting**. The meeting will commence with a discussion of the lecture video. If you do not watch the lecture video beforehand, the meeting will be postponed.
