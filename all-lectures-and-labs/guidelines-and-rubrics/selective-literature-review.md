# Selective literature review

## Definition

A selective literature review gathers scholarly sources that directly relate to your specific research variables. It focuses only on the most relevant literature for your independent and dependent variables as you finish your paper. Unlike broader approaches (like citation chaining or using discovery engines), this method is more targeted and helps you find precisely what you need.

## Check your ResearchRabbit literature diagram

1. You may see relevant articles there.

## Prepare your search strategy

1. Identify the final versions of your three independent variables and one dependent variable.
2. For each variable (three independent variables and one dependent variable), create a list of potential keywords, including synonyms and related terms.

## Conducting searches in google scholar

1. Go to [**Google Scholar**](https://www.scholar.google.com).
2. Use quotation marks for exact phrases: "social media addiction".
3. Use Boolean operators to combine terms:
   1. AND: narrows results (anxiety AND depression)&#x20;
   2. OR: broadens results (adolescents OR teenagers)&#x20;
   3. NOT: excludes terms (depression NOT bipolar)
4. **Use parentheses** for complex searches: (anxiety OR stress) AND (adolescents OR teenagers)
5. **Use the "cited by" feature** to find newer papers that cite an important source.

## Findingdefinitions and conceptual work

1. To find papers that define concepts, use special search phrases:
   * "**\[your variable]** is defined as"
   * "**\[your variable]** refers to"
   * "**\[your variable]** is conceptualized"
   * "definition of **\[your variable]**"
   * "conceptual framework of **\[your variable]**"

## Evaluating source relevance

1. Check the title and abstract first. If it doesn't seem relevant, stop reading.
2. Check citation count (higher counts often indicate influence)
   1. Be wary of sources with extremely low citation counts (unless very recent)

## Helpful tricks

1. Use Google Scholar's "Related articles" link that appears under each result
2. Look at the reference lists of highly relevant papers (citation chaining)
3. Check the author profiles of key researchers in your field to find their other work

## Integrating with previous methods

1. Connect your selective literature findings with sources discovered through citation chaining and ResearchRabbit. Add new articles to your ResearchRabbit literature diagram to see even more relevant articles
