## Sample draft research memo

### [**Sample draft research memo here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ztZ_YJSLWejYitRIhZiJVfkFGMkeU965?rtpof=true\&usp=drive_fs)

## Word count

Minimum **1,000** words of text excluding bibliography.

## The goal

The goal of writing a draft research memo is to&#x20;

* develop a topic with a research question that can be answered with qualitative content analysis methods, and&#x20;
* explain in detail what literature and methods you use to answer the research question.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Writing is easier as you read
{% endhint %}

In this stage of your research, you are to write a draft, not a final paper. Everything you write for the draft or other assignments can be used for your final paper.

The draft research memo is fundamentally structured around prior assignments, incorporating a mix of relevant copying and pasting, crafting transition sentences or paragraphs, and ensuring that all criteria outlined in the rubric are met.

Those previous assignments are:&#x20;

* \[DRM] Choosing annual review articles and determining research items&#x20;
* \[DRM] Citation chaining and discovery engine
* \[DRM] Basic content analysis&#x20;
* \[DRM] Coding your own data for draft research paper&#x20;
* \[DRM] Coding your own data for draft research paper 2

Note: Submissions without data analysis that is generated in "Coding your own data for draft research memo" will automatically receive zero.

You've been using citation chaining and ResearchRabbit until now. Moving forward, use [**Selective Literature Review** ](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/selective-literature-review)to focus directly on your specific research variables.

You will need to find the full PDF version of the articles. If you do not have access to them, please email me ([ttezcan@csumb.edu](mailto:ttezcan@csumb.edu)) with the title and the link of the articles. Make sure the link does NOT start with [https://csu-mb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/](https://csu-mb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/)

## Sections

1. **Introduction and background:** Clearly state the topic. What are you investigating? What is the significance of the topic? Why does it matter? Highlight the significance of the topic. Cite some of your sentences here. End this section with your research question.
2. **Theoretical structure and hypotheses:** Review the relevant literature and construct relevant associations to your own research topic. Do not summarize others’ works like A claimed this, B asserted that! Analytically use and interpret them as long as they benefit your own research. Define the key concepts here. In your project, for instance, if you are working on return migration, explain and cite what return migration is. Under section 2, you will provide a broader explanation of the literature. You will be more specific under the subsections 2.1., 2.2., and 2.3.
   * **2.1. “The relationship between first independent variable and dependent variable” (You will name this subsection, for example Discrimination and Return migration):** Review the specific relevant literature about the relationship between your first independent variable and dependent variable. Explain what you expect to find and your reasoning. End this subsection with your first hypothesis.
   * **2.2. “The relationship between second independent variable and dependent variable” (You will name this subsection, for example Transnationalism and Return migration):** Review the specific relevant literature about the relationship between your second independent variable and dependent variable. Explain what you expect to find and your reasoning. End this subsection with your second hypothesis.
   * **2.3. “The relationship between third independent variable and dependent variable” (You will name this subsection, for example Children and Return migration):** Review the specific relevant literature about the relationship between your third independent variable and dependent variable. Explain what you expect to find and your reasoning. End this subsection with your third hypothesis.
3. **Methodology:** Your content analysis should include mainstream or social media posts (NOT peer-reviewed journal articles for data analysis), newspaper article comment sections, any social media platforms, YouTube comment sections, or blogs, etc. Explain from which media platform you got data. What are your data selection criteria? Paste at least 5 links of the data at the end of this section (Newspaper article, Facebook group, TikTok videos, Instagram posts, etc.)
4. **Results:** The standard approach to this section of a research paper is to present and describe the results in a systematic and detailed way. You will highlight and comment on the themes that emerge from the analysis. More elaborate commentary on the results will be provided in the final paper. Clearly state whether you confirm or reject each of your hypotheses. Discuss your initial, axial, and focused codes here, and organize your results based on the focused codes. Remember not to include all your results. You should present and discuss only those findings that relate to your hypotheses and accordingly your research question. Do not just summarize your content; you should direct the reader to the component or components of it that are especially striking from the point of view of your research aim. Try to ask yourself what story you want the content to convey and try to relay that story to your readers. Provide some quotations from the content you used.
5. **References (Bibliography):** Cite a minimum of 6 sources (ONLY peer-reviewed journal articles) in APA style. Books, book chapters, or other sources, such as reports found on google or websites, are NOT acceptable.

## Grading

As no two draft research memos are the same, grading will be a somewhat subjective business. However, below I provide a list of things I expect to find in all draft research memos. These are the things on which I will assess the research memos and assign grades. The draft research memo is worth 100 points, and there are items below, which are worth 5 to 15 points each.&#x20;

I will rate your draft research memos from these items and the sum will represent your draft research memo grade. The grading of each item will be based on how clearly and completely you address each question posed.

I place no strict limits on the length of each section. Your goal is to specifically discuss and justify your proposed content analysis, which generally takes 1,000 words of text (12-point Times New Roman font with 1” margins, (single spaced typed), excluding bibliography references. If you do not meet the minimum word count (1,000 words), your grade will be adjusted proportionally.

## Reminders

**Reminder 1:** Submissions without data analysis that is generated in "Coding your own data for draft research memo" will automatically receive zero.

**Reminder 2:** Do not use direct quotes from the peer-reviewed articles (-10 points for each):&#x20;

**Reminder 3:** When citing peer-reviewed articles, only provide the in-text citation within the text and the end-text citation under the references (bibliography), do not write the title of the article in the text.

Should be:&#x20;

“Szinovacz (1998) argued that grandparenthood has a multifaceted nature which lacks clear perceived and ascribed roles, and may embody different meanings, expectations and experiences in distinct cultural settings.”

“Family unity across generations is vital for family survival (Nesteruk and Marks, 2009).”

**NOT acceptable (-10 points for each):**&#x20;

* “In his work entitled ‘<mark style="color:red;">Research on grandparenting: needed refinements in concepts, theories, and methods’</mark> Szinovacz (1998) argued that grandparenthood has a multifaceted nature which lacks clear perceived and ascribed roles, and may embody different meanings, expectations and experiences in distinct cultural settings.
* “The study titled ‘<mark style="color:red;">Grandparents across the ocean: Eastern European immigrants struggle to maintain intergenerational relationships</mark>’ argues that family unity across generations is vital for family survival (Nesteruk and Marks, 2009).”
