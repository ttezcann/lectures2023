## 3. Word count

Minimum **1,000** words of text excluding bibliography (references).

## 4. The goal

The goal of writing a draft research memo is to&#x20;

* Develop a topic with a research question and results that can be answered using qualitative content analysis method,
* Explain in detail what literature and method you have used to answer the research question.

{% hint style="info" %}
Writing is easier as you read
{% endhint %}

In this stage, you are to write a draft, not a final paper. But, this is not a proposal either. Do not use future tense. You've already conducted your research.

Use everything you have prepared for this class in your draft research memo.

The draft research memo builds on your prior assignments. Incorporate relevant material from these assignments, add transition sentences or paragraphs, and ensure all rubric criteria are met.

Previous assignments to use&#x20;

* \[DRM] Choosing annual review articles and determining research items&#x20;
* \[DRM] Citation chaining and discovery engine
* \[DRM] Basic content analysis&#x20;
* \[DRM] Coding your own data for draft research paper\*&#x20;
* \[DRM] Coding your own data for draft research paper 2\*

\*Note: Submissions <mark style="color:red;">without data analysis</mark> from "Coding your own data for draft research memo" <mark style="color:red;">will automatically receive zero.</mark> This assignment is assigned twice. If students receive, for example, 85 from one of these assignments, the maximum grade they can get from draft research memo, presentation, and final research memo is 85.

## 5.  Workflow

### Starting

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**On this page:**

1. Read the "7. Sections" part to understand what to expect
2. Review the "2. Sample draft research memo"
3. Read the "9. Rubric" items
4. Read the "10. Reminders"
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Open and make a copy of the template file**

1. Open the "1. Template file".&#x20;
2. File <mark style="color:red;">➜</mark> Make a copy <mark style="color:red;">➜</mark> Relevant week subfolder (Preferably Week 16).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Review previous feedback**

1. Review my feedback from assignments shown in Figure 1.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Theoretical structure and hypotheses section

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**"\[DRM] Coding your own data for draft research memo"**

Open your "\[DRM] Coding your own data for draft research memo" or "\[DRM] Coding your own data for draft research memo 2" (whichever is the more recent) assignment. Use your responses in question 5.

1. Paste Hypothesis 1 at end of  **"2.1" subsection** in your draft research memo. _Hypothesis 1: I expect to find that…_
2. Paste Hypothesis 2 at the end of  **"2.2" subsection** in your draft research memo. _Hypothesis 2: I expect to find that…_
3. Paste Hypothesis 3 at the end of  **"2.2" subsection** in your draft research memo. _Hypothesis 3: I expect to find that…_
4. Paste your Research question at the end of **"1. Introduction and background" section** in your draft research memo. "_The research question of this study is as follows... \[insert your research question]_"
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Previous paragraphs**

Open your "\[DRM] Citation chaining and discovery engine" assignment and find the three paragraphs from question 4.

1. If these paragraphs are still fully relevant to your hypotheses (the current variable composition) pasted above and if you didn't receive feedback for these paragraphs, then:
   1. Paste Paragraph 1 under **"2.1" subsection** in your draft research memo before Hypothesis 1
   2. Paste Paragraph 2 under **"2.2" subsection** in your draft research memo before Hypothesis 2
   3. Paste Paragraph 3 under **"2.3" subsection** in your draft research memo before Hypothesis 3
      1. Name these subsections based on your variables (e.g., 2.1. Discrimination and Return migration)
   4. Open "\[DRM] Choosing annual review articles and determining research items" assignment and check question 2 (paragraphs). Paste anything relevant for the **2.1., 2.2., 2.3. subsections**
2. If you modified your variables:
   1. Only paste relevant sentences from previous assignments.
   2. Write new sentences and cite peer-reviewed journal articles.
      1. First, check your peer-reviewed journal article list from question 5 of "\[DRM] Citation chaining and discovery engine"; there may be some relevant articles to your new hypotheses.
      2. Then, go to [**researchrabbitapp.com**](https://researchrabbitapp.com/) and check your ResearchRabbit literature network analysis; there may be some relevant articles to your new hypotheses.
      3. And/or, conduct [**Selective Literature Review**](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/selective-literature-review)**.**
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### **Methodology and Results sections**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Previous methodology responses**

1. Open your "\[DRM] Basic content analysis" assignment and check your "Essay" for the question 2. Then, open your "\[DRM] Coding your own data for draft research memo" assignment and check the question 3. These are essentially the same questions progressed on each other.
   1. Paste both answers under "3. Methodology" section in your draft research memo.
   2. Combine both answers and remove the duplicate information.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Previous results responses**

1. Open your Open your "\[DRM] Coding your own data for draft research memo" or "\[DRM] Coding your own data for draft research memo 2" (whichever is the more recent)  assignment and check the question 6. Paste this essay under the **"4. Results"** **section** in your draft research memo.&#x20;
   1. Remove the research question from here, as you already mentioned it in **"1. Introduction and background"** section.
   2. Open your "My data" file and check the coding table at the very end. For each focused code, find one or two most representative quotes from the media content you analyzed.
   3. Explicitly mention if you confirm or reject your hypotheses (pasted under **2.1., 2.2., 2.3. subsections)** after discussing each focused code.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Finalizing

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Read everything**

1. Read everything you prepared so far on your draft research memo file.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Finalize the sections**

1. Write the **"2. Theoretical structure and hypotheses"** section.
   1. You need to define your key concepts (variables). There's a guideline in  [**Selective Literature Review**](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/selective-literature-review)  page for this.
2. Write the **"1. Introduction and background" section**.
3. Finally, complete "Self-grade sheet" at the very end of the draft research memo file.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

You've been using citation chaining and ResearchRabbit until now. Moving forward, use [**Selective Literature Review** ](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/selective-literature-review)to focus directly on your specific research variables.

## 7. Sections

1. **Introduction and background:** Clearly state the topic. What are you investigating? What is the significance of the topic? Why does it matter? Highlight the significance of the topic. Cite some of your sentences here. End this section with your research question.
2. **Theoretical structure and hypotheses:** Review the literature and construct relevant associations to your own research topic. Do not summarize others’ works like A claimed this, B asserted that! Analytically use and interpret them as long as they benefit your own research. Define the key concepts here. In your project, for instance, if you are working on return migration, explain and cite what return migration is. Under section 2, you will provide a broader explanation of the literature. You will be more specific under the subsections 2.1., 2.2., and 2.3.
   * **2.1. “The relationship between first independent variable and dependent variable” (You will name this subsection, for example Discrimination and Return migration):** Review the specific relevant literature about the relationship between your first independent variable and dependent variable. Explain what you expect to find and your reasoning. End this subsection with your first hypothesis.
   * **2.2. “The relationship between second independent variable and dependent variable” (You will name this subsection, for example Transnationalism and Return migration):** Review the specific relevant literature about the relationship between your second independent variable and dependent variable. Explain what you expect to find and your reasoning. End this subsection with your second hypothesis.
   * **2.3. “The relationship between third independent variable and dependent variable” (You will name this subsection, for example Children and Return migration):** Review the specific relevant literature about the relationship between your third independent variable and dependent variable. Explain what you expect to find and your reasoning. End this subsection with your third hypothesis.
3. **Methodology:** In the Methodology section, give an account of how you carried out your research. An experienced researcher should be able to repeat the research and reproduce the results based on this section.\
   \
   Your content analysis should include mainstream or social media posts (NOT peer-reviewed journal articles for data analysis), newspaper article comment sections, any social media platforms, YouTube comment sections, or blogs, etc. Explain from which media platform you got data. What are your data selection criteria? Paste at least 5 links of the data at the end of this section (Newspaper article, Facebook group, TikTok videos, Instagram posts, etc.)
4. **Results:** The standard approach to this section of a research paper is to present and describe the results in a systematic and detailed way. You will highlight and comment on the themes that emerge from the analysis. More elaborate commentary on the results will be provided in the final paper. Clearly state whether you confirm or reject each of your hypotheses. \
   \
   Discuss your axial and focused codes here, and organize your results based on the focused codes. Remember not to include all your results. You should present and discuss only those findings that relate to your hypotheses and accordingly your research question. Do not just summarize your content; you should direct the reader to the component or components of it that are especially striking from the point of view of your research aim. Try to ask yourself what story you want the content to convey and try to relay that story to your readers. Provide some quotations from the content you used for each focused code.
5. **References (Bibliography):** Cite a minimum of 6 sources (ONLY peer-reviewed journal articles) in APA style. Books, book chapters, or other sources, such as reports found on google or websites, are NOT acceptable.

## 8. Grading

As no two draft research memos are the same, grading will be a somewhat subjective business. However, below I provide a list of things I expect to find in all draft research memos. These are the things on which I will assess the research memos and assign grades. The draft research memo is worth 100 points, and there are items below, which are worth different points each.&#x20;

I will rate your draft research memos from these items and the sum will represent your draft research memo grade. The grading of each item will be based on how clearly and completely you address each question posed.

I place no strict limits on the length of each section. Your goal is to specifically discuss and justify your proposed content analysis, which generally takes 1,000 words of text (12-point Times New Roman font with 1” margins, (single spaced typed), excluding bibliography (references). If you do not meet the minimum word count (1,000 words), your grade will be adjusted proportionally.

## 10. Reminders

**Reminder 1:** Submissions without data analysis that is generated in "Coding your own data for draft research memo" will automatically receive zero.

**Reminder 2:** Do not use direct quotes from the peer-reviewed articles (-10 points for each):&#x20;

**Reminder 3:** When citing peer-reviewed articles, only provide the in-text citation within the text and the end-text citation under the references (bibliography), do not write the title of the article in the text.

Should be:&#x20;

“Szinovacz (1998) argued that grandparenthood has a multifaceted nature which lacks clear perceived and ascribed roles, and may embody different meanings, expectations and experiences in distinct cultural settings.”

“Family unity across generations is vital for family survival (Nesteruk and Marks, 2009).”

**NOT acceptable (-10 points for each):**&#x20;

* “In his work entitled ‘<mark style="color:red;">Research on grandparenting: needed refinements in concepts, theories, and methods’</mark> Szinovacz (1998) argued that grandparenthood has a multifaceted nature which lacks clear perceived and ascribed roles, and may embody different meanings, expectations and experiences in distinct cultural settings.
* “The study titled ‘<mark style="color:red;">Grandparents across the ocean: Eastern European immigrants struggle to maintain intergenerational relationships</mark>’ argues that family unity across generations is vital for family survival (Nesteruk and Marks, 2009).”
