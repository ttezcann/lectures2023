# Class structure and how to work (Summer term)

## <mark style="color:orange;">Structure</mark>

There are eight weeks in the summer term, with two lectures each week. Below is an overview from the SOC 120 class for Week 3, which includes two lectures:

1. Social Structure
2. What is Critical Thinking?

Each lecture is accompanied by three assignments (indented items are assignments):

Click on the lecture names to see the readings, slides, and lecture videos. See [\[Where are the readings, slides, and lecture videos?\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/where-are-the-readings-slides-and-lecture-videos)

After completing the "Google Drive Assignment," each lecture should be submitted from Google Drive. You will not download or upload documents. See [\[How to submit an assignment\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/how-to-submit-an-assignment)

## <mark style="color:orange;">How to work for this class?</mark>

For each lecture, you will submit a:

1\) Lecture reflection

2\) Lecture specific assignment

3\) Lecture quiz.

Begin with the reading assignment. As you read, complete the first section of the lecture reflection (reading reflection).

Next, watch the lecture video. While watching, complete the second section of the lecture reflection (video reflection).

Afterward, complete the lecture-specific assignment.

Finally, take the lecture quiz. These quizzes are time-limited, so it is important to complete the lecture reflection and the lecture-specific assignment first.

## <mark style="color:orange;">What to aim?</mark>

Always aim to be at least one week ahead. For example, if we are currently in week 3, work on completing the assignments for week 4.
