# Class structure and how to work (Summer term)

## <mark style="color:orange;">Class structure</mark>

There are eight weeks in the summer term, with two lectures each week. Below is a sample overview from the SOC 120 class for Week 3, which includes two lectures:

1. Social Structure
2. What is Critical Thinking?

Each lecture is accompanied by three assignments (indented items are assignments associated with the specific lecture above):

Click on the lecture names to see the readings, slides, and lecture videos. See [\[Where are the readings, slides, and lecture videos?\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/where-are-the-readings-slides-and-lecture-videos)

After completing the "Google Drive Assignment," each lecture should be submitted from Google Drive. You will not download or upload documents. See [\[How to submit an assignment\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/how-to-submit-an-assignment)

## <mark style="color:orange;">How to work for this class?</mark>

For each lecture, you will submit a:

1. Lecture reflection
2. &#x20;Lecture specific assignment
3. Lecture quiz.

Begin with the reading assignment. As you read, complete the first section of the lecture reflection (reading reflection).

Next, watch the lecture video. While watching, complete the second section of the lecture reflection (video reflection).

Afterward, complete the lecture-specific assignment.

Finally, take the lecture quiz. These quizzes are time-limited, so it is important to complete the lecture reflection and the lecture-specific assignment first.

## <mark style="color:orange;">What to aim?</mark>

Always aim to be at least one week ahead. For example, if we are currently in week 3, work on completing the assignments for week 4.

### Assignment submissions

1. Assignments should not be attached. For this lecture, students will not download or upload any documents.&#x20;
2. Assignments should be submitted to Canvas using Google LTI:  [\[How to submit an assignment\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/how-to-submit-an-assignment).
3. As explained in [\[How to submit an assignment\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/how-to-submit-an-assignment),&#x20;
   1. The copied version of the Google Doc assignments  must be in the correct weekly subfolders. If they are not, move them:  [\[How to move a file in Google Drive\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/how-to-move-a-file-in-google-drive)
   2. If the name of the weekly subfolders or Google Doc assignments are incorrect. rename them: [\[How to rename a file and folder in Google Drive\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/how-to-rename-a-file-and-folder-in-google-drive)
4. When the lecture assignment has a [\[Highlighting and Commenting\] ](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/highlighting-and-commenting-assignment-instructions)link at the very top, students must annotate the instructions following the [\[Highlighting and Commenting\] ](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/highlighting-and-commenting-assignment-instructions)guideline before starting the assignment; otherwise, they will receive a -10 penalty.&#x20;
5. When there is “WC” (Word count) under the responses, students must provide the word count of their responses; otherwise, they will receive a <mark style="color:red;">-5 penalty.</mark> Incorrect word counts also receive a <mark style="color:red;">-5 penalty</mark>.

### Incorrect submissions

1. I will grade the assignments submitted to Canvas. When graded, the grade is final. There is no resubmission option. <mark style="color:red;">I do not accept assignments via email, message, or Canvas comment.</mark>
2. If there is no document in weekly subfolder, there is no credit. The assignment will be graded with <mark style="color:red;">10% deduction</mark> when the file is moved to the relevant week's subfolder and <mark style="color:red;">"moved"</mark> is typed in the Canvas comment section of the assignment.
3. If students mistakenly submit the wrong document, they should comment <mark style="color:red;">"submitted a wrong document"</mark> on the Canvas assignment comment section <mark style="color:red;">before it is graded</mark>. In such cases, I will grade the correct document from their Google Drive weekly subfolder without deduction. Assignments revised after the due date do not qualify for this option. If there is no document in the relevant Google Drive weekly subfolder, this option does not apply.
4. If students mistakenly submit the wrong document, but they did not put a comment on the Canvas assignment comment section, again, I will grade what is submitted on Canvas. However, if the correct document was already in the Google Drive folder and completed before the deadline, I will regrade with a <mark style="color:red;">10% deduction</mark>, using the Google Doc Version History. Assignments revised after the due date do not qualify for this option.

### Deadlines

1. After the deadline has passed, Canvas will automatically give a zero, but students are granted <mark style="color:red;">one (1) additional (flexibility) day</mark> to submit their work without a deduction.
2. Once the assignment deadline and the one additional day has passed, students are granted an additional two-day window to submit their work. A <mark style="color:red;">20% deduction</mark> will be applied for the first day of delay, and a <mark style="color:red;">30% deduction</mark> in total for the second day of delay.
3.  After three days, the highest possible grade a student can receive for the assignments is 60%. To receive 60%;&#x20;

    1. Week 1 - Week 4 assignments must be submitted at the end of Week 4 (6/30);&#x20;
    2. Week 5 - Week 8 assignments must be submitted at the end of Week 8 (7/26).&#x20;

    Note that even a submission that is just a second late (11:59:01 pm) will be counted as a full day’s delay as a part of the Canvas system.
