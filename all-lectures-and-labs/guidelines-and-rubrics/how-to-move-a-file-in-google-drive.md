# How to move a file in Google Drive

You can use the following instructions for two purposes:

1. Before submitting a file, always check which folder it is in to avoid losing points.
2. If the file is in the wrong folder, move it to the correct one.

Click on the "move" icon between the star and cloud icons.

If the "correct location" is correct, you are good to go.

If this file needs to be under Week 2, Click "Starred," (see above picture), double click on the class folder, click on "Week 2" and "Move."
