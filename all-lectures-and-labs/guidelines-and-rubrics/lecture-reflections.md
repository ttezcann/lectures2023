# Lecture reflections

## <mark style="color:orange;">Lecture reflection templates</mark>

Use the lecture reflection template files, which are at the bottom of this page.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Submission</mark>

Submit the copied version of the specific lecture reflection template to "Lecture reflection submission" link on Canvas (located in the "Resources" module, which is the first module).

## <mark style="color:orange;">Deadline</mark>

The deadline for the lecture reflection is the same as that of the lecture's assignment. Review the 'Late/Missed/Incorrect Work' section of the syllabus.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Synopsis</mark>

Lecture reflections <mark style="color:red;">(700 words)</mark> are composed of two reflections in a single document:

1. Reading reflection: addressing three parts <mark style="color:red;">(250 words)</mark>
2. Lecture video reflection:  150 words for the 1/3; minimum 150 words for the 2/3; and minimum 150 words for the rest of the lecture video <mark style="color:red;">(450 words)</mark>

## <mark style="color:orange;">Where are the readings, slides, and lecture videos?</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
There are two guidelines below:&#x20;

(1) Reading reflection &#x20;

(2) Lecture video reflection
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:orange;">1) Reading reflection guideline</mark>

Students will submit a reading reflection <mark style="color:red;">(250 words or more)</mark> on an assigned reading.

After completing the reading, students write comprehensive responses for two questions (Question 1 and Question 2) . Then, they formulate a question about the specific issue that they discussed in the second question (Your Question).

While the first question asks for the main points of the reading, the second question needs students to focus on a specific issue in the reading. Then, students formulate a question about the specific issue that they discussed in the second question. Students should make sure to provide enough justification/ground in Question 2 for their question to provoke some discussion.

<mark style="color:orange;">**Question 1:**</mark> What is the main point of this reading? What is the main idea that the reading points out? Your response is not a summary of the readings, but an analysis of it in a way that creates new meaning for you **(15 points)**.

<mark style="color:orange;">**Question 2:**</mark> What is the specific issue/topic you are most interested in presented in assigned reading for the lecture? Write a paragraph to teach this specific issue/topic to your peers and prepare to present it in class. Type the specific issue in parenthesis first **(20 points)**.&#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;">**Your Question:**</mark> The purpose of this section is to dive deeper into the specific topic or issue you discussed in Question 2, stimulating a rich discussion among your peers. Your question should be about the specific issue/topic you stated in “Question 2”, something you already know the answer to  (**15 points)**.

Your question should be comprehensive, requiring multiple follow-up questions. It should be detailed and complex enough to open avenues for extensive discussion. Your question should spark some discussion and you will be able to lead that discussion

* **Complexity**: Instead of posing a single, broad question, present a primary question followed by 2-3 related follow-up questions.
* **Specificity**: Avoid vague or over-generalized questions. They should relate directly and specifically to the topic you presented in Question 2.
* **Depth**: Each question should invite in-depth analysis and reflection, rather than simple 'yes' or 'no' answers.
* **Open-endedness**: While you should already know the answers to your questions, they should be crafted in such a way that they encourage diverse viewpoints and interpretations.
* **NO policy-oriented questions:**  Policy-oriented questions, such as <mark style="color:red;">**“what can we (or society, governments, etc.) do to help,”**</mark> while significant in their own right, are not acceptable in this course as they often assume the existence of certain societal patterns without a prior rigorous understanding and analysis. We must first focus on acquiring an in-depth understanding of societal structures, interactions, and patterns to form well-informed inquiries before we delve into policy considerations or suggestions.

{% hint style="danger" %}
- Students should not provide direct quotes from the readings, but explain them in your own words **(Otherwise -10 per direct quote)**.
- Students should not mention the title of the reading **(Otherwise -10)**. For example, “The article of The Past, Present, and Future of Research in Distance Education: Results of a Content Analysis concentrates on….” Instead, type “the reading,” “the article,” etc.
- Students also need to put the word count (WC) at the end of the post: (WC: 262) **(Otherwise -5)**.
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:orange;">Reading reflection rubric for grading</mark>

Responses to questions clearly indicate careful reading and deep reflection.&#x20;

Your questions will be evaluated based on academic quality, sociological, methodological, and reading relevancy.&#x20;

Descriptive and policy-oriented questions like

* “What are the different sampling strategies? Describe and discuss”,&#x20;
* “What should society do to eliminate discrimination?”,&#x20;
* “How can we fix the labor market barriers”,&#x20;
* “What can we (or society, governments, etc.) do to help immigrants in terms of housing, educational opportunities, etc.”,&#x20;

Questions with answers that are already on the reading like

* "What are the two border control strategies?",
* "What are the different sampling methodologies?"

will result in <mark style="color:red;">zero points</mark>.

## <mark style="color:orange;">2) Video reflection guideline</mark>

Upon completion of the reading reflection, students are required to submit a lecture video reflection of at least <mark style="color:red;">450 words</mark> on a designated lecture **(50 points)**.

The reflection process involves segmenting the lecture video into three equal parts:

* <mark style="color:orange;">The first third of the video (1/3),</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:orange;">The second third of the video (2/3),</mark>
* <mark style="color:orange;">The remaining third of the video.</mark>&#x20;

For instance, in a 25-minute video, the divisions could be approximately 8 minutes, 8 minutes, and 9 minutes, respectively. Alternatively, they could be divided as 9-8-8 or 8-9-8 minutes. Should a particular segment of the video focus extensively on a specific slide, leading to a slight imbalance in the division (such as 10-8-7 minutes), this is acceptable.

At the conclusion of each third (both the first and second), students should note the time code (in minute:second format) where the segment ends, e.g., (1) 07:23 and (2) 14:12.

### <mark style="color:orange;">Video reflection rubric for grading</mark>

When composing the lecture video reflections, students should achieve two primary objectives:

* Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the lecture content,
  * For each segment of the video, identify the key concepts or theories presented.
  * Provide an explanation of the identified concept or theory in your own words and understanding. <mark style="color:red;">Do not paraphrase what the slides or videos mention</mark>.
  * Discuss its significance within the context of the lecture.
  * Reflect on why those concepts or theories is crucial to the overall understanding of the subject matter.
* Persuasively assure the instructor that they have watched the entire video,
  * Connect points from each video segment to a real-world example. This can include current events, historical instances, case studies, or personal experiences that illustrate the concept in action.
  * Draw connections between the lecture content and the assigned reading materials. Discuss how the video complements, expands, or challenges the ideas presented in the readings.
  * Write thoughtful questions or critiques regarding the lecture content.

Submissions followed the criteria above will get full credit for this part.
