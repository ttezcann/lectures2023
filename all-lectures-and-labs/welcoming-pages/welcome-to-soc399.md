# Welcome to SOC399

## <mark style="color:orange;">Welcome!</mark>

Welcome to SOC399 - Contemporary Immigration!

My name is Tolga Tezcan and I'm your instructor. [You can check me CV here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16HdRvPXse\_88mQysbXL6SdoQP2MEhRmX/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=100179871492576617561\&rtpof=true\&sd=true).

This page will make you familiar with the course, structure, what to expect, and some other important information.

## <mark style="color:orange;">First meeting</mark>

Our first meeting is held on 08/27 - Tuesday at 12 pm at [Heron Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/YgdtjK5542qNHV8Z9) - Room 160.

Please arrive the classroom at least 5 minutes early.

I will explain the class structure, go over the syllabus in detail, and answer your questions.

There will be a **graded attendance quiz**. Make sure to bring an electronic device to take the attendance quiz on Canvas. Ensure you have access to Canvas. If you cannot attend the first class, you have an opportunity to write 700 words lecture reflection to compensate for the missed points.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Syllabus</mark>

[The syllabus is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLkKuRUJE81UnZ2JZk-UQ6rGD15mrpMD/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=100179871492576617561\&rtpof=true\&sd=true), also under the "Resources" page of Canvas (The first module).

Read the syllabus before the first class and bring me your questions.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Assignments for the first class</mark>

There are a couple of assignments associated with the first class.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:orange;">Class structure</mark> <a href="#class-structure" id="class-structure"></a>

We have two lectures each week. The first class is lab, the second class is regular lecture.&#x20;

Below is a sample overview, which includes two lectures:

1. RStudio: Descriptive statistics
2. Introduction to survey methodology

Each lecture is accompanied by three assignments (indented items are assignments associated with the specific lecture above):

Click on the lecture names to see the readings, slides, and lecture videos. See [\[Where are the readings, slides, and lecture videos?\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/where-are-the-readings-slides-and-lecture-videos)

## <mark style="color:orange;">Assignments</mark>

1. **Quizzes**: Taken in the class and cannot be taken outside the classroom.
2. **Lecture assignments**: We'll start (and most of the time finish) these assignments during the class.
3. **Lecture reflection**: No need to submit a lecture reflection if you attend the class. Missed in-class quizzes can be compensated with a [lecture reflection](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/lecture-reflections#video-reflection-guidelines). Those who wish to improve specific in-class quiz grades can also submit lecture reflections.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Assignment submissions</mark>

1. Assignments should not be attached. For this lecture, students will not download or upload any documents.
2. Assignments should be submitted to Canvas using Google LTI: [\[How to submit an assignment\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/how-to-submit-an-assignment).

4. When the lecture assignment has a [\[Highlighting and Commenting\] ](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/highlighting-and-commenting-assignment-instructions)link at the very top, students must annotate the instructions following the [\[Highlighting and Commenting\] ](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/highlighting-and-commenting-assignment-instructions)guideline before starting the assignment; otherwise, they will receive a <mark style="color:red;">-10 penalty</mark>.
5. When there is “WC” (Word count) under the responses, students must provide the word count of their responses; otherwise, they will receive a <mark style="color:red;">-5 penalty.</mark> Incorrect word counts also receive a <mark style="color:red;">-5 penalty</mark>.

## <mark style="color:orange;">How to work for this class?</mark>

1. Do the reading before coming to class.&#x20;
2. Review the slides before coming to class.&#x20;
