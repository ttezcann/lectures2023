## <mark style="color:orange;">Welcome!</mark>

Welcome to SSCI321 - Survey Research!

My name is Tolga Tezcan, associate professor of sociology, and I'm your instructor. [You can check my CV here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16HdRvPXse_88mQysbXL6SdoQP2MEhRmX/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=100179871492576617561\&rtpof=true\&sd=true).

This page will make you familiar with the course, structure, what to expect, and some other important information.

## <mark style="color:orange;">"Getting ready for the class" module assignments</mark>

There are four assignments to get ready for the class. You can find these assignments under the module named "Getting ready for the class" (The second module).

Feel free to submit assignments during the break if you wish. I will grade the assignments in 48 hours during the break.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Deadlines</mark>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (118).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. After the deadline has passed, Canvas will automatically give a zero, but students are granted one <mark style="color:red;">(1) additional (flexibility) day</mark> to submit their work without a deduction.
2.  Once the assignment deadline and the flexibility day has passed, students are granted an additional three-day window to submit their work.&#x20;

    \
    A <mark style="color:red;">10% deduction</mark> will be applied for the first day of delay after the flexibility day, a <mark style="color:red;">15% deduction</mark> for the second day of delay, and a <mark style="color:red;">20% deduction</mark> for the third day of delay. Then the submission window closes.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Class structure</mark> <a href="#class-structure" id="class-structure"></a>

We have two lectures each week. The first class is lab, the second class is regular lecture.&#x20;

Below is a sample overview, which includes two lectures:

1. RStudio: Descriptive statistics (lab lecture)
2. Introduction to survey methodology (regular lecture)

Each lecture is accompanied by two assignments (indented items are assignments associated with the specific lecture above):

Click on the lecture names to see the readings, slides, and lecture videos. See [\[Where are the readings, slides, and lecture videos?\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/where-are-the-readings-slides-and-lecture-videos)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (117).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## <mark style="color:orange;">Assignments</mark>

1. **Lecture assignments**: Each regular lecture comes with an assignment.
2. **Lab assignments:** Each lab lecture comes with a lan assignment. These assignments are to assess their data analysis skills in RStudio. Each lab comes with a lab lecture video and sample lab assignment video.
3. **Lecture quizzes**: Each lecture (both regular and lab) comes with a quiz.\
   \
   &#xNAN;**\[Optional] Lecture reflection**: No need to submit a lecture reflection if you're satisfied with your lecture quiz. Low in-class quizzes can be compensated with a [lecture reflection](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/lecture-reflections#video-reflection-guidelines).&#x20;

## <mark style="color:orange;">Exams</mark>

1. Midterm (<mark style="color:red;">10/25 due by 11:59pm</mark> @ online - time limited)
2. Final exam (<mark style="color:red;">12/16 due by 11:59pm</mark> @ online - time limited)

## <mark style="color:orange;">Assignment submissions</mark>

1. Assignments should not be attached. For this lecture, students will not download or upload any documents.
2. Assignments should be submitted to Canvas using Google LTI: [\[How to submit an assignment\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/how-to-submit-an-assignment): This link is located at the top of each assignment.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Incorrect submissions</mark>

Students should review their document <mark style="color:red;">before</mark> and <mark style="color:red;">immediately after</mark> submission.

* Assignments submitted to Canvas will be graded, and grades are final. Do not submit an assignment unless you want to be graded for.
* There is no resubmission option.&#x20;
* Assignments should be submitted to Canvas. Assignments via email, message, or Canvas comment are not accepted.&#x20;
* If there is no document in the Google Drive weekly subfolder, no credit will be given even if a submission is made that would normally receive full credit (see item **2** below).

Some exceptions:

1. **Wrong document submission:**&#x20;
   1. If students submit a wrong document and <mark style="color:red;">comment "submitted a wrong document"</mark> on the Canvas assignment section before grading, the correct document from their Google Drive week folder will be graded without deduction. Assignments revised or created after the due date do not qualify for this option.
   2. If no comment is made and the correct document is already in the Google Drive week folder at the time of grading, it will be graded with a <mark style="color:red;">10% deduction</mark>, using Google Doc Version History. Assignments revised or created after the due date do not qualify for this option.
2.  **Submission made but no document in the Google Drive weekly subfolder:**&#x20;

    If submission is made and there is no document in the weekly subfolder, zero will be given and I will contact the student. Upon notification, the student may move the file to the relevant week's subfolder and type "_moved_" in the Canvas comment section of the assignment. The assignment will then be graded with a <mark style="color:red;">10% deduction.</mark> Assignments revised or created after this communication do not qualify for this option.

## <mark style="color:orange;">How to work for this class?</mark>

1. Do the reading and take notes
2. Review the slides and take notes
3. Watch the lecture video and take notes
4. For lab lectures, watch the sample lab assignment video and take notes
5. Complete the lecture assignment
6. Review your notes, then take the lecture quiz

## <mark style="color:orange;">Late enrollment</mark>

If you are enrolled late in this class, read the syllabus and the welcoming page that was sent through the announcement (check the very top of class Canvas page) immediately. Since you have missed some classes, you can submit lecture reflections to compensate for missed lecture quizzes.&#x20;

As soon as you are enrolled, email me, and I will reasonably adjust the missed deadlines if you are enrolled after those deadlines. Start with the assignments under the “Getting ready for the class” module (the second module) in the order seen on the Canvas module page, then lecture reflections and other assignments.
