# Welcome to SBS321-01 TUTH 12pm FA24

## <mark style="color:orange;">Welcome!</mark>

Welcome to SBS321 - Survey Research!

My name is Tolga Tezcan and I'm your instructor. [You can check me CV here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16HdRvPXse\_88mQysbXL6SdoQP2MEhRmX/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=100179871492576617561\&rtpof=true\&sd=true).

This page will make you familiar with the course, structure, what to expect, and some other important information.

## <mark style="color:orange;">First meeting</mark>

Our first meeting is held on 08/27 - Tuesday at 12 pm at [Heron Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/YgdtjK5542qNHV8Z9) - Room 160.

Please arrive the classroom at least 5 minutes early.

I will explain the class structure, go over the syllabus in detail, and answer your questions.

There will be a **graded attendance quiz**. Make sure to bring an electronic device to take the attendance quiz on Canvas. Ensure you have access to Canvas. If you cannot attend the first class, you have an opportunity to write 700 words lecture reflection to compensate for the missed points.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Syllabus</mark>

[The syllabus is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLkKuRUJE81UnZ2JZk-UQ6rGD15mrpMD/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=100179871492576617561\&rtpof=true\&sd=true), also under the "Resources" page of Canvas (The first module).
