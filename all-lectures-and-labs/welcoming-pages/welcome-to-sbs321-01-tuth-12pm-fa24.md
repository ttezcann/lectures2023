I will explain the class structure,  go over the syllabus in detail, and answer your questions.

There will be a **graded attendance quiz**. Make sure to bring an electronic device to take the attendance quiz on Canvas. Ensure you have access to Canvas. If you cannot make it, you have an opportunity to write 700 words lecture reflection to compensate for the missed points.
