# Welcome to SOC120

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt="" width="356"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## <mark style="color:orange;">Welcome!</mark>

Welcome to SOC120 - Thinking Sociologically!

My name is Tolga Tezcan, Associate Professor of Cociology, and I'm your instructor. [You can check my CV here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16HdRvPXse_88mQysbXL6SdoQP2MEhRmX/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=100179871492576617561\&rtpof=true\&sd=true).

This page will make you familiar with the course, structure, what to expect, and some other important information.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Syllabus</mark>

[The syllabus is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PgIW9ujJzh4wVSwQ-D_Qs7kIwLl30eQR/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=100179871492576617561\&rtpof=true\&sd=true), also under the "Resources" page of Canvas (The first module).

Read the syllabus before the first class and bring me your questions.

## <mark style="color:orange;">First class</mark>

Our first class is held on <mark style="color:red;">01/21</mark> - <mark style="color:red;">Wednesday at 2 pm</mark> at [CAHSS](https://goo.gl/maps/hYxctdN9tuwBnjuT8) - 1102.

Please arrive the classroom at least 5 minutes early.

I will explain the class structure, go over the syllabus in detail, and answer your questions.

There will be a **graded attendance quiz**. Make sure to bring an electronic device to take the attendance quiz on Canvas. Ensure you have access to Canvas.&#x20;

If you cannot attend the first class, you have an opportunity to write 700 words lecture reflection to compensate for the missed points. Click on the "\[firstclass] First class attendance quiz" (module Week 1) for further details. You do not need to submit this if you attend the first class.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:orange;">"Getting ready for the class" module assignments</mark>

There are four assignments to get ready for the class. You can find these assignments under the module named "Getting ready for the class" module (The second module).

Feel free to submit assignments during the break if you wish. I will grade the assignments in 48 hours during the break.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**\[gr] Google Drive assignment (must be submitted first)** <mark style="color:red;">(due by 01/21 - 11:57 pm)</mark>

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## <mark style="color:orange;">Deadlines</mark>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (118).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. After the deadline has passed, Canvas will automatically give a zero, but students are granted one (1) additional (flexibility) day to submit their work without a deduction.
2. Once the assignment deadline and the flexibility day has passed, students are granted an additional three-day window to submit their work.&#x20;
   1. <mark style="color:red;">10% deduction</mark> will be applied for the first day of delay after the flexibility day,
   2. <mark style="color:red;">15% deduction</mark> for the second day of delay,
   3. <mark style="color:red;">20% deduction</mark> for the third day of delay. Then the submission window closes.

### <mark style="color:orange;">Where are the due dates?</mark> <a href="#deadlines" id="deadlines"></a>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## <mark style="color:orange;">Class structure</mark> <a href="#class-structure" id="class-structure"></a>

We have two lectures each week.&#x20;

Below is a sample overview from SOC120 class.

1. Claims and evidence
2. Everyday arguments

Each lecture is accompanied by two assignments (indented items are assignments associated with the specific lecture above):

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (137).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### <mark style="color:orange;">Where are the readings, slides, and lecture videos?</mark>

Click on the lecture names to see the readings, slides, and lecture videos. See [\[Where are the readings, slides, and lecture videos?\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/where-are-the-readings-slides-and-lecture-videos)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (136).png" alt="" width="512"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### <mark style="color:orange;">General format of the lectures</mark>

The general format of the lectures is as follows, though note that adjustments may be made for certain specific lectures:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (119).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## <mark style="color:orange;">Assignments</mark>

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Lecture assignments**</mark>

Each lecture comes with an assignment. We'll start (and most of the time finish) these assignments during the class.

### <mark style="color:orange;">Lecture quizzes</mark>

**Lecture quizzes**: Each lecture comes with a quiz. Taken in the classroom and cannot be taken outside the classroom.

* **\[Optional] Lecture reflection**: No need to submit a lecture reflection if you're satisfied with your lecture quiz. Low in-class quizzes can be compensated with a [lecture reflection](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/lecture-reflections#video-reflection-guidelines).&#x20;

### <mark style="color:orange;">Research memo and presentation</mark>

During the term, students will be conducting content analysis focusing on any subject from the syllabus and addressing their own research interests.

1. **\[DRM]** Draft research memo (10 points – 10%),
2. **\[PRES]** Presentation (10 points – 10%),
3. **\[FRM]** Final research memo (10 points – 10%).

Assignments designed to assist students in preparing components of the research memo will be graded under the “Research Memo (30%)” item. These assignments are identified by the label “\[DRM]” (Draft Research Memo), “\[PRES]” (Presentation), or “\[FRM]” (Final Research Memo) in their names.

Draft research memo, presentation, and final research memo without data analysis (\[DRM] coding your own data for draft research memo) (Week 7 assignment) will automatically receive zero. Mathematically speaking, students who do not complete this assignment will fail. This assignment will be assigned twice. If students receive, for example, 85 from one of these assignments, the maximum grade they can get from draft research memo, presentation, and final research memo is 85.

### <mark style="color:orange;">Assignment submissions</mark>

1. Assignments should not be attached. For this class, students will not download or upload any documents.
2. Assignments should be submitted to Canvas using Google LTI: [\[How to submit an assignment\]](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/guidelines-and-rubrics/how-to-submit-an-assignment): This link is located at the top of each assignment.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">Incorrect submissions</mark>

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Wrong document submission:**&#x20;

* If students submit a wrong document and comment "_submitted a wrong document_" on the Canvas assignment section <mark style="color:red;">before the assignment is graded</mark>, the correct document from their Google Drive week folder will be graded <mark style="color:red;">without deduction</mark>. Assignments revised or created after the due date do not qualify for this option. See "Guidelines and rubrics" <mark style="color:red;">➜</mark> "How to post a comment on an assignment" page on Canvas (the first module called "Resources").
* If no comment is made and the correct document is already in the Google Drive week folder at the time of grading, it will be graded with a 10% deduction, using Google Doc Version History. Assignments revised or created after the due date do not qualify for this option.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Submission made but no document in the Google Drive weekly subfolder:**

If submission is made and there is no document in the weekly subfolder, zero will be given and I will contact the student. Upon notification, the student may move the file to the relevant week's subfolder and type "_moved_" in the Canvas comment section of the assignment.&#x20;

* The assignment will then be graded with a <mark style="color:red;">10% deduction</mark>. Assignments revised or created after this communication do not qualify for this option. See "Guidelines and rubrics" <mark style="color:red;">➜</mark> "How to post a comment on an assignment" page on Canvas (the first module called "Resources").
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Submission made but mistakes detected later:**

If mistakes are detected after submission and students wish to revise their assignment, they should type “_wait_” in the Canvas comment section before the assignment is graded. Once the corrections are made in the Google Drive class folder, they should add a second comment saying, “_check Google Drive_.” The date of the second comment will be considered the official submission date.

* This is the main reason why students should review their document before and immediately after submission.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## <mark style="color:orange;">How to work for this class?</mark>

1. Attend the classes.&#x20;
2. Do the reading before coming to class.&#x20;
3. Review the slides before coming to class.&#x20;
4. Take notes during the class (paper-pen-method).&#x20;
5. Watch the lecture videos after class if you were late or struggled.

## <mark style="color:orange;">What are the benefits of attending classes?</mark>

* **Less work:** No need to write a 700-word lecture reflection to compensate for each missed in-class quiz.
* **Better comprehension:** During the 30-40 minute lecture, you will take notes for lecture quizzes, helping you better understand the content.
* **Immediate feedback:** After the in-class quiz and a 5-minute break, you will begin the assignment, and I will provide individual feedback right away and answer any questions.
* **One-on-one meetings:** I always arrive 15 minutes early to the class and stay 15 minutes late. Schedule an appointment and ask me your questions before or after class, or during the break.
* **Making friends and networking:** Over half of the assignments are done in groups (2-3 members, with different peers each class). This helps you make friends and look forward to seeing each other.
* **College Experience:** Regular attendance provides a real college life experience. College is more than just grades; it is about networking and developing social skills.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Late enrollment</mark>

If you are enrolled late in this class, read the syllabus and the welcoming page that was sent through the announcement (check the very top of class Canvas page) immediately. Since you have missed some classes, you can submit lecture reflections to compensate for missed lecture quizzes.&#x20;

As soon as you are enrolled, email me, and I will reasonably adjust the missed deadlines if you are enrolled after those deadlines. Start with the assignments under the “Getting ready for the class” module (the second module) in the order seen on the Canvas module page, then lecture reflections and other assignments.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Office hours</mark>

1. Monday and Wednesday, 3:30 – 4:30 pm at my office (CAHSS 2306) & before or after my classes. Different in-person and online office hours.
2. And, by appointment
