# Variables in GSS 2022 uc

## Guideline

### What is this document?

This document lists categorical and continuous variables, what they measure, the full wording and response sets of each question from the GSS dataset (2022). Variables are color coded:

### Table 1. Guideline of color codes

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="171">Color codes</th><th>It means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><mark style="background-color:red;"><strong>B</strong></mark> </td><td>Binary variable: it has two responses</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="background-color:green;"><strong>N</strong></mark></td><td>Nominal variable: it has more than two responses</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="background-color:orange;"><strong>O</strong></mark></td><td>Ordinal variable: same as nominal variable, but there is a logical order among categories</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="background-color:orange;"><strong>O</strong></mark> ✅ </td><td>✅ next to an <mark style="background-color:orange;"><strong>O</strong></mark> ordinal variable indicates that these ordinal variables could be treated as continuous</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="background-color:purple;"><strong>C</strong></mark></td><td>Continuous variable: numeric variables; real numbers</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="background-color:blue;"><strong>COMP</strong></mark> </td><td>Indicates that it can be computed together with other variables marked with a <mark style="background-color:blue;"><strong>COMP</strong></mark> in the same color. Note that the computed variable will be continuous.</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="background-color:yellow;"><strong>Recode</strong></mark> </td><td>Indicates that they should be recoded (the direction of the responses should be reversed) before computation or treating them as continuous. After recoding, the new (recoded) variables should be used in analysis.</td></tr></tbody></table>
