## <mark style="color:blue;">1. How to create RStudio Cloud account and installing all the packages</mark>

Follow the procedures described in the [RStudio lab assignment: account and packages assignment instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P0gpXCsAk03u9fSdHNdMpO43TCbHUoJT/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=100179871492576617561\&rtpof=true\&sd=true).

The process is also shown on the video below:

### <mark style="color:blue;">1.1. How to check how many hours left?</mark>

An RStudio Cloud free account allows you 25 hours of connect time per month. Every second the RStudio Cloud is open counts towards this allocated time.&#x20;

Therefore, whenever you are not running code or generating analyses, close the RStudio Cloud browser

Click on your name (see highlighted part #1). The highlighted part #2 shows the time period (e.g., "I will have 25 more hours on Aug 8, 2024"). The highlighted part #3 shows how many hours you have spent.

### <mark style="color:blue;">1.2. What to do if you exceed 25 hours per month?</mark>

25 hours of connect time is enough for this class. If you exceed this limit, open another free account using a different email address. Follow the procedures described in the [RStudio lab assignment: account and packages assignment instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P0gpXCsAk03u9fSdHNdMpO43TCbHUoJT/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=100179871492576617561\&rtpof=true\&sd=true).

### <mark style="color:blue;">1.3. What to do if you want your new free account to be identical (files, packages, etc.) to the previous account where you exceeded the time limit?"</mark>

1. Go to the previous account where you exceeded the time limit.
2. Click "Export" (see the highlighted part)

3. Click "Download"

4. It will download a zip file.
5. Go to your new account.
6. Upload that zip file just like you upload a R script file.







## Not using the new (recoded) variables in computation code

## 2. Computed variables are always continuous

When we compute variables and create an index, the new (computed) variable is continuous.

It becomes CONTINUOUS because we have created a score, and we treat it as a real number.

Therefore, we use the DESCR code to see the distribution (mean and standard deviation)

When we recode a continuous variable, the new (recoded) variable is no longer continuous.

It becomes CATEGORICAL because we have merged the real numbers, and they no longer remain as real numbers.\
Therefore, for example, we use the FRQ code to see the distribution.

## 3. Not using a model code

Use the [Code templates](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lect/all-lectures-and-labs/r-lab/lab-resources/code-templates) page.
