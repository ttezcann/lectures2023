# How to use RStudio on a computer without using a browser

## Using RStudio on a university lab computer

Every time you log in to a lab computer, you have to run "install and load packages" codes.

Because when you log out, lab computers revert to their factory settings and deletes the installed packages.

1. First, download the R Script file that you want to use.  [All R Script files here](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lectures/all-lectures-and-labs/r-lab/lab-resources/all-r-script-files).
2. Type "RStudio" on the search bar of the computer. Open RStudio.
3. On RStudio, Click File <mark style="color:red;">âžœ</mark> Open File.
4. Find the Script file that you just downloaded, and click Open.
5. **DO NOT DOUBLE CLICK R SCRIPT FILES.** It may open R, instead of RStudio.
