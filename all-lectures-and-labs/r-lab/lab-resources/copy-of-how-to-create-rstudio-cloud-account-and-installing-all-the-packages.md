## <mark style="color:orange;">How to check how many hours left?</mark>

An RStudio Cloud free account allows you 25 hours of connect time per month. Every second the RStudio Cloud is open counts towards this allocated time.&#x20;

Therefore, whenever you are not running code or generating analyses, close the RStudio Cloud browser

Click on your name (see highlighted part #1). The highlighted part #2 shows the time period (e.g., "I will have 25 more hours on Aug 8, 2024"). The highlighted part #3 shows how many hours you have spent.

## <mark style="color:orange;">What to do if you exceed 25 hours per month?</mark>

25 hours of connect time is enough for this class. If you exceed this limit, open another free account using a different email address. Follow the procedures described in the [RStudio lab assignment: account and packages assignment instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P0gpXCsAk03u9fSdHNdMpO43TCbHUoJT/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=100179871492576617561\&rtpof=true\&sd=true).

### <mark style="color:orange;">What to do if you want your new free account to be identical (files, packages, etc.) to the previous account where you exceeded the time limit?"</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}

1. Go to the previous account where you exceeded the time limit.
2. Click "Export" (see the highlighted part)
