# Interpretation templates

## <mark style="color:orange;">Interpretation structure</mark>

This class will ask you to interpret specific analysis tables using specific variables.

Here's the order you need to follow:

1. Copy (ctrl or command + C) the variable name from the assignment document.
2. Open "[Variables in GSS](https://ttezcan.gitbook.io/lect/all-lectures-and-labs/r-lab/lab-resources/variables-in-gss-2022-uc)" document.
3. Open the search function on the page (ctrl or command + F).
4. Paste the variable name (ctrl or command + V).
5. Read the "full wording of the question", "response set", and "what it measures" column of the variable, and understand what the specific variable is about.
6. Find the analysis type below (maximize your browser window to display the outline on the right side for easier navigation)
7. You will see a sample table, a sample interpretation, and an interpretation template.
8. Check the sample table and read the sample interpretation.
9. Copy the interpretation template, paste into your assignment document, and change inside.
   1. You need to use "what it measures" column when interpreting analyses. **Do not** use variable names or the text appears on the top of the table in the interpretation.
10. After the "what it measures" column, add the word of "variable" in your interpretation.
11. You need to use the "response set" or "labels" (as appeared on the analysis tables) in your interpretation.
12. Depending on the variable, you need to tweak some parts of the interpretation. For example, "_15.4% of the respondents are/have/feel/think/said/reported"_ etc.
13. When the interpretation is completed, read it aloud and make sure it makes sense. Ensure that your interpretations are clear enough for someone to understand your report **without** referring to the tables.

## Chi-square (example 1): insignificant p-value

We utilize crosstabs for chi-square analysis, which is used to discover if there is a relationship between two categorical variables (we check the p value). We refer to statistically significant as p < 0.05. The Chi-Square Test can only compare categorical variables.&#x20;

```r
sjt.xtab(gss$sex, gss$health, show.row.prc = TRUE)
```

Independent variable first (sex), dependent variable second (health)

## Correlation analyses

### Correlation analysis structure

Correlation analysis examines the linear relationship of two continuous variables.

IF the p-value is statistically significant (<0.05);

* less than |0.3| … weak correlation
* |0.3| < | r | < |0.5| … moderate correlation
* greater than |0.5| ………. strong correlation

The order of the variables does not matter.

### (1a) Correlation analysis table (significant p-value, positive correlation)

```r
tab_corr (gss[, c("sei10", "spsei10")],
wrap.labels = 30, p.numeric = TRUE, triangle="lower", na.deletion = "pairwise")
```

Read "correlation analysis structure" above first.

{% hint style="success" %}
There is a significant correlation between \[what it measures column of variable 1] and \[what it measures column of variable 2] since the p-value is less than .05.&#x20;

**OR** This correlation is positive and moderate since the r-value is 0.xxx (between |0.3| and |0.5|).

**OR** This correlation is positive and strong since the r-value is 0.xxx (higher than |0.5|).

## Linear regression analysis

In regression, we explain the effects of independent variables on the dependent variable by estimating how changes in the independent variables are associated with changes in the dependent variable.\
Unlike correlation analysis, regression analysis can be used to determine the direction and strength of a potential causal relationship.

```r
model4 <- lm(conrinc ~ god + age + physhlth + educ, data = gss)
tab_model(model4, show.std = T, show.ci = F, collapse.se = T, p.style = "stars")
```

&#x20;Dependent variable (conrinc) first, followed by the independent variables separated by a plus (+).

### Linear regression analysis interpretation breakdown

{% hint style="success" %}
**First paragraph:** \[The significance levels] Mention which variables (“what it measures”) are statistically significant (if any), and which variables are statistically insignificant (if any). Variables with at least one asterisk (\*) are statistically significant.

<mark style="color:blue;">Respondents’ age, days of poor physical health past 30 days, and respondents' education in years are statistically significant predictors of respondents’ personal income since the p values are less than 0.05. Respondent's confidence in the existence of God is not a statistically significant predictor of respondents’ personal income since the p value is greater than 0.05.</mark>

_\[What it measures column of significant independent variable 1], \[what it measures column of significant independent variable 2], and \[what it measures column of significant independent variable 3]...  are statistically significant predictors of \[what it measures column of the dependent variable] since the p values are less than 0.05. \[What it measures column of insignificant independent variable 1], \[what it measures column of insignificant independent variable 2]... are not a statistically significant predictor of \[what it measures column of the dependent variable] since the p value is greater than 0.05._\


**Second paragraph:** \[The explanation of coefficients (Estimates column)] Mention how significant independent variables increase or decrease the value of the dependent variable, using the “Estimates” column. When reporting the estimates (coefficients), ensure that the sentence includes the units (one unit, a day, a score, a year, a dollar, etc.) of both the independent and the dependent variable.

<mark style="color:blue;">A year increase in respondents’ age increases respondents’ personal income by $504. A day increase in poor physical health past 30 days decreases respondents’ personal income by $857. A year increase in the respondents’ education  increases respondents’ personal income by $4,845.</mark>&#x20;

**Third paragraph:** \[The explanation of standardized betas (std.Beta column)] Mention the strongest predictors (variables) of the dependent variable using the “std.Beta” (standardized beta) column in order. Only mention the statistically significant ones. “std.Beta” is an absolute number, which means -.56 is stronger than .45.

<mark style="color:blue;">The strongest predictor of respondents’ personal income is the respondents' education in years (std.Beta=0.34), followed by respondents’ age (std.Beta=0.17), and the days of poor physical health past 30 days (std.Beta=-0.13).</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
Age of the respondents, days of poor physical health past 30 days, the years of education, being male, being very happy, and being pretty happy are statistically significant predictors of respondents’ income since the p values are less than 0.05. Respondent's confidence in the existence of God is not a statistically significant predictor of respondents’ income since the p value is greater than 0.05.

A year increase in age increases respondents’ income by $489. A day increase in poor physical health past 30 days decreases respondents’ income by $654. A year increase in the years of education increases respondents’ income by $5,185. Being male increases income by $15,624 compared to being female. Being very happy increases income by $15,779 compared to being not too happy. Being pretty happy increases income by $8,908 compared to being not too happy.&#x20;

The strongest predictor of respondents’ income is the years of education (std.Beta=0.36), followed by being male (std.Beta=0.19), the age of the respondent (std.Beta=0.17), being very happy (std.Beta=0.16), being pretty happy (std.Beta=0.11), and the days of poor physical health past 30 days (std.Beta=-0.10).

The adjusted R squared value indicates that 22.2% of the variation in respondents’ income can be explained by the years of education, age of the respondents, and days of poor physical health past 30 days, being male, being very happy, and being pretty happy.
{% endhint %}

### Reporting of dummy variable estimates (coefficients)

{% hint style="success" %}
When reporting the coefficients of dummy variables, ensure that the sentence includes "being" or "having," as well as the omitted (comparison) dummy variable.&#x20;

This is because creating dummy variables essentially means creating new variables, which changes the information they measure (aka "what it measures").&#x20;

For example, if you create "male" and "female" dummy variables based on the "respondents' sex" variable, the "male" dummy variable now measures "being male," and the "female" dummy variable now measures "being female."

* <mark style="color:purple;">Being male</mark> increases income by $15,624 <mark style="color:orange;">compared to being female</mark>.&#x20;

If you create "veryhappy," "prettyhappy," and "nottoohappy" dummy variables based on the "happiness level" variable, the "veryhappy" dummy variable now measures "being very happy," the "prettyhappy" dummy variable measures "being pretty happy," and the "nottoohappy" dummy variable measures "being not too happy."

* <mark style="color:purple;">Being very happy</mark> increases income by $15,779 <mark style="color:orange;">compared to being not too happy</mark>.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">Being pretty happy</mark> increases income by $8,908 <mark style="color:orange;">compared to being not too happy</mark>.

If you create "ownhouse" and "renthouse" dummy variables based on the "home ownership" variable, the "ownhouse" dummy variable now measures "having a house" (or "owning a house"), and the "renthouse" dummy variable measures "renting a house."

* <mark style="color:purple;">Having a house</mark> increases life satisfaction by 3.2 points  <mark style="color:orange;">compared to renting a house</mark>.

OR

* <mark style="color:purple;">Owning a house</mark> increases life satisfaction by 3.2 points  <mark style="color:orange;">compared to renting a house</mark>.
